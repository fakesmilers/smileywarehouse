This guide is for self-compilation.

@SirStarshine which version do you try to install my ppa or ubuntu version?

apt-cache policy pcsx2-unstable:i386
Then post the full log of

apt-get install pcsx2-unstable:i386
Again so far with your limited log

unity-control-center : Depends: libcheese-gtk23 (>= 3.4.0) but it is not going to be installed
Depends: libcheese7 (>= 3.0.1) but it is not going to be installed
E: Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks, this may be caused by held packages.
Issue isn't related to PCSX2 but unity.
